# Simple multilayered feed forward network

A very simple multilayered feed forward network. Did this for a seminar paper during summer term '19.
Great for simple learning tasks like MNIST or IRIS Database. An application of the net in context with Multi layered vs single layered comparison of learning the MNIST dataset of handwritten numbers can be found in the file MNIST.py.
